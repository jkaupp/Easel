**What data to use**

- University Benchmark results over many years

*Data shown was fabricated for Easel.* 

**How do I use this visualization?** 
Each bar in this visualization represents a benchmark rating, grouped into various categories. Each set of bars represents multiple years over which that rating was measured. The colour helps indicate what category each measure is linked to. 
The visualization is meant to be used as a way to quickly identify which measures a university is doing well or poorly in, and how that's changed over time. 
In this example visualization, we can see that this fictitious institution 	is generally doing average or well in most measures and improving in almost all. However, there are certain measures like "% Aboriginal Students" and the whole Graduate Outcomes category that it is measuring poorly in.
Ideally, data for such a visualization is normalized to some standard across universities. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
Using small-multiples is a good way to summarize lots of information across many categories. In this case, since the measures were normalized and all measured over the same number of years, it is easy to plot them in the same format. When someone viewing the visualization is able to interpret one set of bars, they can quickly use sense to analyze what is happening in the other facetted bar charts.
