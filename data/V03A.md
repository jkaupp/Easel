**What data to use**

- Results from various assessments over a course
- Student IDs
- Student demographic/grouping data

*Data shown are based on anonymized, measured results.*

**How do I use this visualization?** 
Here, each horizontal line represents a student measured over multiple assessments, facetted beside each other for each group. The visualization provides an overview, rather than a detailed look about how individual students are performing. From it, we can tell what the distribution of performances among the assessements and groups. In this example specifically, we can see that Group A has generally higher performers with a narrower spread and have mostly consistent students. Groups B and D however, have a much wider range of students and may require more attention. However, Group B seem to have more students declining while Group D seem to have many students that are improving. Additional interactivity would allow being able to highlight specific students. 

**Why did we select this visualization?**
The primary goal here is to be able to see all the groups at once as well as the change between multiple assessments. With parallell coordinates, you are able to see the dispersion as well as the change in individual students rather than just the mean.
